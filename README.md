# Willow
Willow is a programming language.

## Goals

### Mandatory
   - Full documentation
   - Good tools (i.e. compiler/interpreter, editor, etc)
   - Simple syntax

### Nice-to-Have
   - Other language interoperability
     - This would most likely be with Swift

## Compiler

The Willow compiler is called Alba (after the species White Willow, i.e. Salix alba).

## Editor

The Willow editor is called Salix (after the species White Willow, i.e. Salix alba).
